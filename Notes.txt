For this project, the training set is comprised of the first 19 days of each month, 
while the test set is the 20th to the end of the month. 
My goal was to predict the total count of bikes rented during each hour covered by the test set, 
using only information available prior to the rental period.

I was provided with hourly rental data spanning two years.
